Call `help(int)` to learn how to tell the `int` function that the input is specified in binary.)  For example, if the string is `\"01010010\"`, then the integer should be $82 = 64 + 16 + 2$.\n",

It's fine to use a traditional `def` function instead of a lambda function; use whatever you think is the most readable.  Depending on how you write this function, you may want to use list comprehension somewhere, but you don't have to force it.  For example, if you have a string `m` and you want to get a list of its characters, just use `list(m)`, there's no reason to use `[c for c in m]` to make that list.)"
